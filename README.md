# Image Classifier
## AIM
The goal is train a classifier using 102 categories of flowers. The trained model will take an image as an input and predict the
probabilities of 10 top classes.This is also an opportunity to practise deep learning

## Method
I will be using pytorch for training. A pre-trained model 'VGG16' will be used together with the classifier I defined

## Usage
